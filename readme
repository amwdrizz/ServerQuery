ServerQuery is designed for use with Existing HLDS (Half-Life Dedicated Server)

For website intergration please just put the contents of the folder CURRENT into the folder
of which you plan on using this script. So if it is for your entire site then you would
upload to /public_html.

Prior to upload you should edit the config.inc.php to reflect the values for you server
and if you wish to use multiple servers or not.

Then in your index page or the page you wish to implament this script on place at the top
of the page 

Edit the loader.php file to refelct the following

Find 
$HL->maintpl(); //......
Replace with

// $HL->maintpl();
<?php
require_once("loader.php");
?>

That will load all the correct files and load the link for you to use.

The link to place were you want the template to be placed is

<?php
$HL->maintpl();
?>

And load the page you put the code into and it should work.

-----------------
2b) Standalone Install

Configure the config.inc.php file with directions above and upload to your website.

Rename loader.php to be you index.php file and it should load up with your server info
